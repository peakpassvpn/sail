//! A hundred instances in one process, on sail's runtimes and then on the

//! left on the host's runtime, no file, no thread, no runtime id, no heap.
//! A binary of its own: it counts the process's threads, files and heap.
//!
//! The heap is counted by this binary's allocator, not read from RSS: with
//! ten runtimes at once, glibc keeps a heap arena for each of their threads,
//! and RSS grows by hundreds of MB that it never returns, while the bytes
//! alive stay where they were.
