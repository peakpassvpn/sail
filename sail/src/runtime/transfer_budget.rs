//! What all of a process's growable transfer buffers may grow by,
//! together: Hysteria2's and TUIC's windows and the send buffers of the
//! TCP connections inbounds accept.
//!
//! quinn (sail's fork) grows a stream's receive window while it is read
//! about as fast as data arrives, the connection's with it, and the send
//! window with the congestion window; an accepted connection's send buffer
//! grows while it, not the network, is what holds the client's transfer
//! back (`net::send_buffer`). Every growth past the starting sizes is asked
//! of the [`TransferBudget`] first. One budget for the process lets one
//! transfer take a large share while many share it, and bounds what they
//! can hold at once: a far server's download needs the windows and not the
//! LAN send buffer, a near one's the send buffer and not the windows
//! (sail#9, sail#10).
//!
//! The budget follows the memory too: once a second at most, when a
//! buffer asks to grow, it reads what is free (and, where it has a bound,
//! what the process holds), and lets buffers grow by no more than leaves
//! `memory.free_memory_floor` free. A cgroup's use counts its sockets'
//! memory, so what send buffers took leaves the windows less, and the
//! reverse. It is read when asked, not on a timer: the limit only matters
//! to a growth, and an idle process never wakes for it.
