//! What connections send and receive: each connection's own counts, which
//! the Clash API lists, and the totals of each user, inbound and outbound,
//! which go on across reloads and, with `experimental.cache_file`, across

//!
//! Nothing here takes a lock every connection shares. The live connections
//! are kept in shards, each behind a lock held only to add or remove one;
//! a connection is removed when the last of what counts it is dropped.
//! Each read or write adds to the connection's, its user's, its inbound's
//! and its outbound's counts, with atomic additions only. Inbounds and
//! outbounds are shared by every connection, so their counts are striped:
//! a thread adds to a stripe of its own, and a read sums them.
