//! Mihomo's `prefer-h3`: an `https` server asked over HTTP/3 beside
//! HTTP/2, and kept to HTTP/3 once that answers, as Mihomo's DoH client,
//! after AdGuard's dnsproxy, has it.
//!
//! Which one a query goes over is the choice: unknown at first, and again
//! after a network move; HTTP/3 once an HTTP/3 query was answered;
//! HTTP/2 for a while once one failed. While it is unknown, a query goes
//! over both at once and the first answer is taken, but the choice is
//! the HTTP/3 query's alone, which runs on to its end: a kept HTTP/2
//! connection would answer first every time, and HTTP/3 never be taken
//! up. An answer is a DNS message, whatever its rcode; a failure is a
//! connection that failed or timed out, or an HTTP error.
