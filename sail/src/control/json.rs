//! The JSON hosts are answered with, the C ABI and the management API
//! alike: sail's own shape, the control types serialized in snake_case
//! with typed fields (the Clash API renders Mihomo's from the same types).
//!
//! It carries no version number. It only grows: a field, a type or a
//! string value may be added, and a host ignores what it does not know
//! (the Swift and Kotlin bindings do). Taking a field away, renaming it, or
//! changing its type or meaning breaks hosts: it follows the sail release
//! and goes in the release notes; the management API takes it to a new
//! path (/api/v2). The snapshot test below, which the bindings' tests read
//! too, catches a change made by accident.
