description: "sail 原生配置格式（sing-box v1.14.2 JSON 与 sail 扩展）的逐字段参考。"
---

本页由 `website/scripts/build-config.mjs` 生成，请勿手改：它读取 sail 的配置类型（Rust 源码）、sing-box 字段注册表（`sail/src/config/singbox/fields.json`，sing-box v1.14.2）及注册表测试实测的分级（`fields.tiers.json`）。修改源码注释或上述文件后在 `website/` 下执行 `npm run docs:config`。

- **状态**：sing-box 的字段按注册表测试逐一实测：**支持**（读取并生效，不接受的取值仍报错）、**警告**（忽略并警告）、**报错**（拒绝该配置），并附理由；**sail 扩展** 为 sing-box 没有的字段与类型。
- **类型**：sing-box 字段取 sing-box 的 JSON 类型；扩展字段取自 sail 的 Rust 定义。
- **默认**：取自 sail 的 serde 声明；“未设置”表示可省略，省略时的行为见说明。只有 sail 读取的字段才列默认值。
- **说明**：sail 源码注释，保留原文；没有注释的扩展字段取注册表测试的说明。
- **构建条件**：Rust 源码中的 `cfg` 条件（Cargo feature 与平台）。

用 `sail -c config.json -T` 校验配置。编辑器可按 JSON schema 校验与补全：在配置顶层写 `"$schema": "https://peakpassvpn.github.io/sail/schema.json"`（由同一生成器产出；sail 报错的字段标为不允许，警告的标为弃用）。Clash 与 Surge 的支持表见[兼容性](/sail/zh/reference/compatibility/)。
