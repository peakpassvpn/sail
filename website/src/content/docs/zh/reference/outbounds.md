description: "sail 原生配置格式（sing-box v1.14.2 JSON 与 sail 扩展）的逐字段参考。"
---

本页由 `website/scripts/build-config.mjs` 生成，请勿手改：它读取 sail 的配置类型（Rust 源码）、sing-box 字段注册表（`sail/src/config/singbox/fields.json`，sing-box v1.14.2）及注册表测试实测的分级（`fields.tiers.json`）。修改源码注释或上述文件后在 `website/` 下执行 `npm run docs:config`。

- **状态**：sing-box 的字段按注册表测试逐一实测：**支持**（读取并生效，不接受的取值仍报错）、**警告**（忽略并警告）、**报错**（拒绝该配置），并附理由；**sail 扩展** 为 sing-box 没有的字段与类型。
- **类型**：sing-box 字段取 sing-box 的 JSON 类型；扩展字段取自 sail 的 Rust 定义。
- **默认**：取自 sail 的 serde 声明；“未设置”表示可省略，省略时的行为见说明。只有 sail 读取的字段才列默认值。
- **说明**：sail 源码注释，保留原文；没有注释的扩展字段取注册表测试的说明。
- **构建条件**：Rust 源码中的 `cfg` 条件（Cargo feature 与平台）。

用 `sail -c config.json -T` 校验配置。编辑器可按 JSON schema 校验与补全：在配置顶层写 `"$schema": "https://peakpassvpn.github.io/sail/schema.json"`（由同一生成器产出；sail 报错的字段标为不允许，警告的标为弃用）。Clash 与 Surge 的支持表见[兼容性](/sail/zh/reference/compatibility/)。

A hash of the server's own certificate takes it outright: no CA and no name are checked, so that exact certificate is trusted for any server name. A hash of a certificate sent after it, an intermediate or a root, is the only CA the server's certificate is verified by, with the server name. |

Rust 定义：[`UrlTestOutboundOptions`](https://github.com/peakpassvpn/sail/blob/dev/sail/src/protocol/group/urltest/mod.rs) · 构建条件：`feature = "outbound-urltest"`

| `interval` | duration | 未设置 | 支持 | — |
| `tolerance` | number | `50` | 支持 | Milliseconds. |
| `idle_timeout` | duration | 未设置 | 支持 | Tests pause once the group has not been used for this long; 30m, sing-box's. A Clash `url-test` group, lazy, has it equal to its `interval`, as Mihomo's. |
| `interrupt_exist_connections` | bool | `false` | 支持 | Ends the connections through the member left once the group switches. |
| `providers` | string 或 数组，元素为 string | `[]` | sail 扩展 | The outbound providers, by tag, whose outbounds join the group's own, in this order. |
| `filter` | string 或 数组，元素为 string | `[]` | sail 扩展 | Regular expressions, as Mihomo's `filter`: of the providers' outbounds, only those whose names match one are members, those of the first first. The group's own outbounds are not filtered. |
| `exclude_filter` | string 或 数组，元素为 string | `[]` | sail 扩展 | Regular expressions no member's name may match, the group's own outbounds' too. |

| `empty_fallback` | string | 未设置 | sail 扩展 | An outbound, not a group, that is the member while there is none else. Without it such a group has none, and its connections fail. |
| `timeout` | duration | 未设置 | sail 扩展 | How long a test may take before its member counts as failed; 5s. Also how close together `max_failed_times` failures must come; Mihomo's `timeout`. |
| `max_failed_times` | number | 未设置 | sail 扩展 | How many failed connections, within `timeout` of the first, have the members tested again; 5, as Mihomo's `max-failed-times`. One whose member's server cannot be reached has them tested at once. |
| `expected_status` | string | 未设置 | sail 扩展 | The HTTP statuses a test must be answered with to pass, as Mihomo's `expected-status`: codes and ranges, `200/204/401-429`; any when unset. |
| `lazy` | bool | `true` | sail 扩展 | `false`: tests never pause, used or not, as Mihomo's `lazy: false`; `idle_timeout` is then a mistake. |
