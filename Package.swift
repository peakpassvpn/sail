// swift-tools-version:5.9
// sail for Swift: the C ABI (sail-ffi/include/sail.h) as Swift, from
// bindings/swift. At the repository's root so that an app adds it by URL:
//
//   .package(url: "https://github.com/peakpassvpn/sail", from: "<version>")
//
// Here SailC is libsail, sail-ffi's static library, which
// `bindings/swift/test.sh` builds and links for the tests; a release's tag
// has SailC as the XCFramework the release publishes.
