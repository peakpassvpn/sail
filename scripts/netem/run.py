"""Weak-network and long-run tests (roadmap 5.5).

Run as root on the Linux test host, from this directory:

Two network namespaces (netns.sh): nc5 (nc$NETEM_NS) holds the client under
test and the traffic tool, ns5 (ns$NETEM_NS) the protocol server (sing-box,
the reference) and the traffic tool's server. Every scenario shapes the link between them with
netem, runs the traffic tool's checked workloads through the client's
SOCKS inbound, and samples the client's memory, CPU, descriptors and TCP
states. Results: <work>/results/<run>/summary.json, and the raw records
of each client, gzipped, kept only where something failed.

# Each shaping applies to both directions: an RTT of R is a delay of R/2
# each way. netem gives each packet a delay of its own, and without a rate
# sends them in the order of those delays: jitter alone reorders, and the
# cell would measure reordering, which reorder5/25 do. With a rate, netem
# sends no packet before the one ahead of it (sch_netem.c, netem_enqueue),
# as a path's queue does. Measured at 100 ms RTT, hy2 bulk: 4-7 Mbit/s
# reordered, 217 in order, 328 without jitter. The rate paces what netem
# lets go: at 100gbit a packet whose delay ends early leaves with those
# held behind it at once, and a burst of thousands overran the receiving
# CPU's backlog (netdev_max_backlog): at 25 +/- 10 ms each way, BBR's
# upload lost 2058 packets there and retransmitted 2072, none at 1gbit,
# at about the same rate (2026-10-25). A rate this close to the cells' own
# caps them, as netem spaces each packet after the one ahead of it, its
# delay included: at 1gbit, hy2 and tuic at rtt50 reached 550-600 Mbit/s,
# 750-960 at 2gbit and 830-1010 at 4gbit, sail's downloads 10% more than
